Hello Everyone,

About data:-

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey or SDSS is a multi-spectral imaging map using at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. It is the most detailed three-dimensional map of the universe ever made, with multi-color images of one third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects.
Data used in this project are results from a query which joins two tables: PhotoObj, which contains photometric data, and SpecObj, which contains spectral data. Data is retrieved from SkyServer SQL Search.


Goals & Target:-

Here in the project i m trying to do the classification of different star ,galaxies, quasars on sky-server data set, with the help of different machine learning classification model & EDA ,preprocessing, & visualization of data is also done, where ever needed in this project.KNN model & Logistic regression is giving maximum accuracy.

Steps involved to acchive target:-
